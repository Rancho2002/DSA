Finally received the #gccp #swags after completing a month long Google cloud campaign which consists of 4 courses and 3 quests based on cloud by Qwiklabs .

It is really fun and not possible without our facilitator Dipayan Sarkar and lead Debarun Acharya as well as my friends. Thanks to everyone. Also, I helped many juniors to complete this event. Some face problems in creating bucket some, creating IAM.. and so many things. At the end it's a great journey indeed.

Looking forward to more such events ðŸš€ðŸš€ Google Cloud
