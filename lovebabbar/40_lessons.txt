vid 10: two pointer approach used to do many things in one iteration
vid 11: calculate complexity practically using exactly worst case
vid 12: binary search applied on monotonic function also  to avoid integer overflow due to sum of two 10^7 terms, we can write it like this-> start + (end-start)//2

vid 14: 
pivot element is the element where the array get breaks into two sorted subset but if joined then they become one sorted array. For example, 7 8 9 1 2 3 here pivot is arr[3] because if I join it, it become 1 2 3 7 8 9
to search inside rotated sorted array you have to find the pivot index then break into two sequence . one is 0 to pivot-1 and another is pivot to n-1

vid 15: (book allocation)
1) take 0 to 100 no of pages and calculate mid 
2) now start sum up, if sum>mid, do partition and start another sum, if it go equals to number of students then continue, if exceeds then
